checkin - stupid timetracking
=============================

Checkin is a simple commandline tool to manage
time you spent doing something. I used it to
track my worked hours as a student assistant.


## Usage

For more information please look at the two markdown-manpages, in
the man-directory, or generate the corresponding manpages
with the rake-command.

`checkin` allows you to keep track of your worked time.
You can checkin so called **timeslots** to represent
given work hours. You can also list your worked time in a month
by hours for each day. 

<code> checkin -l [-f <em>config-file</em>] [-d <strong>date</strong>]</code>

<code> checkin -s [-f <em>config-file</em>] [-d <strong>date</strong>]</code>

<code> checkin [-d <strong>date</strong>] -b <strong>time</strong> -e <strong>time</strong></code>

- `-b` **time**  
  Defines the given **time** as the starttime of a timeslot.
  Format is: `HH:MM`.
  Forces occurrence of `-e`. Assumes the current day if no date
  is specified by using the `-d`-switch.

- `-d` **date**  
  Assumes the given Date for the other switches.
  This switch support different formats dependend on which 
  it is used with. 
    when using `-l` *or* `-s`: `MM/YYYY`
    when using `-b` *and* `-e`: `DD.MM.YYYY`

- `-e` **time**  
  Defines the given **time** as the endtime of a timeslot.
  Format is: `HH:MM`.
  Forces occurrence of `-b`. Assumes the current day if no date
  is specified by using the `-d`-switch.

- `-f` *config-file*  
  Instead of using the default config-file (residing in ~/.config/checkin/checkin.cfg)
  another config-file as denoted by the argument is used.

- `-l`  
  Lists the worked time for each day in the current month. If another
  month is suggested by the `-d`-switch this month (and year)
  is used instead.

- `-s`  
  Prints the status of the current month. By default it only
  presents the worked hours and minutes of the current month
  (which is overriden by the `-d`-switch). If specified in a *config-file*
  it shows more useful stats.

- `-v`  
  Be more verbose...!

### Shell

If **checkin** is invoked without any arguments it is started in interactive
mode, commonly known as *shell*.  Currently the shell is in experimental phase,
but it supports at least one thing command-line arguments don't: dynamic
start/stop.

- `list`  
  Invokes list display of the current month. Also takes optional *month*
  argument, or *month/year* argument.
- `start`  
  Starts a so-called recording session. The current time will be stored.  This
  way you can dynamically allocate the worked time, by just checking in at the
  beginning (and end), of your work. Works in conjunction with `stop`.
- `stop`  
  Stops a running recording session. The current time will be stored as the end
  of the timeslot. You will be askes for confirmation. Confirmation can be
  provided by either entering "y" or "yes". "n" and "no" will deny storage and
  the timeslot will be *lost*.

## Things to be done

- adding useful notes to timeslots
- editor-integration (like git-commit)
  - especially jumping to `$EDITOR` when commiting to a timeslot  
    (for the description)
- full shell integration
