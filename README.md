checkin - stupid timetracking
=============================

Checkin is a simple commandline tool to manage
time you spent doing something. I used it to
track my worked hours as a student assistant.


## Usage

For more information please look at the two markdown-manpages, in
the man-directory, or generate the corresponding manpages
with the rake-command.

`checkin` allows you to keep track of your worked time.
You can checkin so called **timeslots** to represent
given work hours. You can also list your worked time in a month
by hours for each day. 

<code> checkin -l [-f <em>config-file</em>] [-d <strong>date</strong>]</code>

<code> checkin -s [-f <em>config-file</em>] [-d <strong>date</strong>]</code>

<code> checkin [-d <strong>date</strong>] -b <strong>time</strong> -e <strong>time</time></code>

- `-b` **time**  
  Defines the given **time** as the starttime of a timeslot.
  Format is: `HH:MM`.
  Forces occurrence of `-e`. Assumes the current day if no date
  is specified by using the `-d`-switch.

- `-d` **date**  
  Assumes the given Date for the other switches.
  This switch support different formats dependend on which 
  it is used with. 
    when using `-l` *or* `-s`: `MM/YYYY`
    when using `-b` *and* `-e`: `DD.MM.YYYY`

- `-e` **time**  
  Defines the given **time** as the endtime of a timeslot.
  Format is: `HH:MM`.
  Forces occurrence of `-b`. Assumes the current day if no date
  is specified by using the `-d`-switch.

- `-f` *config-file*  
  Instead of using the default config-file (residing in ~/.config/checkin/checkin.cfg)
  another config-file as denoted by the argument is used.

- `-l`  
  Lists the worked time for each day in the current month. If another
  month is suggested by the `-d`-switch this month (and year)
  is used instead.

- `-s`  
  Prints the status of the current month. By default it only
  presents the worked hours and minutes of the current month
  (which is overriden by the `-d`-switch). If specified in a *config-file*
  it shows more useful stats.

- `-v`  
  Be more verbose...!

## Things to be done

- use a packaging system (like autotools)
- adding useful notes to timeslots
- editor-integration (like git-commit)
- other small gadgets to make living easier ;)
